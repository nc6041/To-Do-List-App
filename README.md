Brief description of the processing capabilities of your application’s back end, and how it will make effective use of the hash table data structure:
Users will be able to insert new dates and the tasks for those days into the tree and search for and retrieve the data/plans/events for a specific day within the tree. As users insert and remove events they have from the calendar, it will rotate to rebalance itself.
